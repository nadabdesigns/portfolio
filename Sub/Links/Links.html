					Many of the works we covered in my Typography and Interactions class were contemporary thought
					examinations and critiques of the design industry, engaging with topics such as inclusivity, the
					attention economy, and AI. This project involved designing a landing page to present five
					web-integrated projects developed over the course of the year. <br><br>
					If you are a creative professional, you’re probably aware that we are at a highly disruptive point
					in design history, with these themes acting as major forces that define this moment in design
					culture. Naturally, my designs for this class critically engage with these same notions. While some
					may argue that technology feels more encompassing than ever before, many of us are craving a return
					to the tactile. I wanted to emphasize this cultural pivot point in my landing page.<br><br>
					With the rise of AI, human error is seen less as a hindrance and more as a stamp of authenticity.
					For the visual identity, I wanted to approach the design with authenticity through materiality.
					Utilizing assets from my Designer as a Cultural Nomad project, I used a digital scan of fur as the
					landing page imagery. The use of a handheld scanner allowed the medium to preserve the imprints of
					human imperfection, such as distortion and chromatic aberration, caused by the gestural movements of
					my hands. Through these imperfections, I am not only establishing trust with the user; I am also
					emphasizing my more manual approach as a designer.<br><br>
					I added photographic assets and juxtaposed them with flat graphic elements to create visual depth,
					transforming a two dimensional interface into one with three dimensional presence. Each project is
					revealed on hover with a sample image of my work. The screen is partially covered, leaving peepholes
					for intrigue, curiosity, and surprise. Through typography, I used a simple yet tech-forward
					typographic language. Paired with spatial elements and a contemporary color palette, it integrates
					tactility into the web experience in a way that feels refreshing, intriguing, and culturally
					evocative of the attention economy.<br><br>
					Built in response to the cultural implications of our current moment, this site blurs the line
					between the digital and the physical and invites dialogue around contemporary design culture. As
					digital literacy continues to expand and our attention shrinks, the importance of cultural fluency
					becomes increasingly critical. This shift paves the way for interactive experiences that are not
					only digitally captivating but also experientially engaging.
