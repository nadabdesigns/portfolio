					Opal is a pioneering skin and fragrance brand dedicated to creating hypoallergenic fragrances for
					individuals with sensitive skin. Rooted in a soothing, science-driven approach, Opal’s formulations
					begin at the microscopic level, with carefully selected ingredients playing a central role in skin
					compatibility. By utilizing natural notes such as tea-based botanicals and calming bases like
					oatmeal, the formula goes beyond tolerance and supports skin that not only adapts, but thrives.

					<br><br>Challenge<br><br>

					Skincare ingredients are too often overly complex. As a result, individuals with sensitive or
					irritation-prone skin tend to be more cautious about the products they use and are more likely to
					remain loyal to products they know work. Between ingredient conflicts and the confusion that comes
					with trying something new, people with skin sensitivity are often unwilling to risk the health and
					integrity of their skin by experimenting with unfamiliar products.

					Additionally, individuals with sensitive skin often feel constrained by the limited product
					offerings and branding within the market. Among younger demographics, particularly those aged 16 to
					30, existing fragrance and skincare branding can feel misaligned, skewing either overly clinical or
					infantilizing. This disconnect leaves younger, sensitivity-conscious consumers underserved by
					current scent and skincare experiences.

					<br> <br>This project focused on creating a cohesive brand system through multiple design solutions,
					from product form to logotype, that collectively build trust, spark intrigue, and establish
					recognition across all brand touchpoints.

					<br><br>Strategy<br><br>

					The strategy focused on creating a inviting space that encourages exploration for individuals with
					sensitive skin. The product experience is designed to feel thrilling yet controlled, allowing people
					to engage with curiosity while maintaining a sense of security. Trust is established through simple,
					transparent ingredients, while the design and experience offer room for discovery in a way that
					feels confident, elevated, and sensorial.

					<br><br>Visual Identity<br><br>

					The color strategy is rooted in radical inclusivity, drawing from the full spectrum of skin tones
					and the natural flush of skin. Skin-inspired hues are woven throughout the visual identity, ranging
					from deep browns to soft beiges, creating a palette that reflects broad representation and
					familiarity. Accents of red are introduced as subtle cues to inflammation, reinforcing the brand’s
					connection to skin biology while adding visual energy and depth.

					<br><br>Product Design<br><br>

					I aimed to create an attractive, inviting product presence that draws people in at retail. At the
					core of this approach was the perfume’s contemporary form and silhouette. From its long, oblong
					shape that nods to organic forms found in nature, to the materiality and surface treatment, the
					physical design employs tension and variation to create a simple yet engaging presence.
					<br><br>
					Sculpturally, the design is informed by skin’s capacity for defense, particularly through
					inflammation. This concept guided multiple interpretations of color and form throughout the object.
					The use of deep red references inflammatory response, while the sculpted, ergonomic dimples along
					opposing faces of the form enhance grip and tactility. These gestures not only improve ergonomics,
					but also reflect the pliable, resilient nature of healthy skin.
					<br><br>
					Through the use of texture, I took an exploratory approach informed by the anatomy of skin and its
					layered structure, specifically the epidermis and dermis. These references are translated into a
					fragmented form that transitions from the top of the bottle’s silhouette to its base. To create
					moments of visual interest, the design contrasts material expressions across the form. The upper
					portion utilizes translucent material that echoes the natural translucency of skin, while a
					vein-like detail adds visual depth. At the base, rounded substructures mimic cellular
					configurations, grounding the form at a microscopic level.
					<br><br>

					Paired with an ergonomic form, the textural design operates at the intersection of tension and
					allure. Its sculptural language encourages exploration and hands-on interaction, reinforcing the
					product’s tactile, sensory-driven experience.

					<br><br>Logo<br><br>

					This sense of intrigue continues through the use of a topographic logo. Its bulbous lettering and
					angled architectural structure echo a cellular nature. Designed to feel dynamic, the logo carries
					visual weight and an otherworldly quality that is instantly recognizable across multiple
					touchpoints. With a simple name and an intriguing form, it invites closer engagement with the brand.

					<br><br>Results<br><br>

					The resulting design is an unorthodox product form paired with an unconventional logotype that
					clearly distinguishes the brand from its competitors. Balancing experimentation with
					approachability, the system speaks directly to a new generation of buyers through a culturally
					attuned visual language. From digital circulation to in-store purchasing, intrigue is activated
					across multiple user journeys. Through its form and visual identity, the design invites interaction
					across all brand touchpoints. Designed for virality, the product appeals to a cult-like following
					that strengthens long-term brand loyalty.
