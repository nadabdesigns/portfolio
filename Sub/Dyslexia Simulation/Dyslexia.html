				<p class="p2">Affecting 80 to 90 percent of those diagnosed with learning disabilities, dyslexia
					stands as the most widespread learning difference. Despite its prevalence, dyslexia is often
					misunderstood within educational and diagnostic systems, as the severity and specific nature of
					its challenges can vary greatly from person to person.<br><br>
					I designed a dyslexia simulation as an empathetic tool grounded in my own challenges with
					reading and writing. Through this interface, I aimed to highlight the urgency of legislation and
					other support systems that safeguard individuals with learning disabilities in educational
					settings.<br><br>
					Drawing from my earliest encounters with dyslexia, the site’s visual language is rooted in the
					sensory cues of childhood learning. Oversaturated colors, thick lines, and simplified forms
					recall the pedagogical tools of early education. These graphic elements are reinterpreted
					through a typographic lens, forming a visual system that mirrors both the clarity and chaos of
					navigating reading as a neurodivergent learner.<br><br>
					Strain takes on a major theme in the ethos of this site. Before embracing my differences, I saw
					my dyslexia as a great strain on my academic success. For me, its challenges extend beyond
					decoding text and into the sensory realm: marked by overstimulation, frustration, and cognitive
					fatigue. These aspects are often underrepresented or misinterpreted in portrayals of dyslexic
					experiences. For my site’s design, I aimed to unveil strain as a defining feature, and it's a
					theme I’ve intentionally embedded in the site’s visual identity.<br><br>
					My approach was to examine strain in two forms: the pedantic and subversive. Each stakes out a
					portion of the site through the landing page and the home page. The pentadic landing page was
					designed to overstimulate through strenuous reading circumstances. With oversaturated colors,
					long line lengths, and a distracting animation, it takes an anti-user experience approach that
					embodies the physical sensation of weight that dyslexia might impose on an individual. On the
					homepage, however, you're met with a more forgiving UI that allows you to experience a more
					reductive, literal stance on the dyslexic experience, such as mixing up letters and seeing
					rivers in text.<br><br>
					This duality moves experience beyond surface-level interpretations of dyslexia, inviting users
					to engage with the emotional and sensory weight it carries. More than a visual simulation, the
					interface was designed to reflect the internal reality: how dyslexia feels, not just how it
					functions. Altogether, the work serves as a more powerful tool for empathy, highlighting the
					importance of support systems that protect individuals with learning disabilities in educational
					settings.
